# 0x04. Typescript

0. Creating an interface for a student

Copy the following configuration files (provided above) into the task_0 directory: package.json, .eslintrc.js, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

Write your code in the main.ts file:

Write an interface named Student that accepts the following elements: firstName(string), lastName(string), age(number), and location(string)
Create two students, and create an array named studentsList containing the two variables
Using Vanilla Javascript, render a table and for each elements in the array, append a new row to the table
Each row should contain the first name of the student and the location


1. Let's build a Teacher interface

Create a directory task_1 and copy these configuration files into this folder: package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

firstName(string) and lastName(string). These two attributes should only be modifiable when a Teacher is first initialized
fullTimeEmployee(boolean) this attribute should always be defined
yearsOfExperience(number) this attribute is optional
location(string) this attribute should always be defined
Add the possibility to add any attribute to the Object like contract(boolean) without specifying the name of the attribute

2. Extending the Teacher class

Write an interface named Directors that extends Teacher. It requires an attribute named numberOfReports(number)

3. Printing teachers

Write a function printTeacher:

It accepts two arguments firstName and lastName
It returns the first letter of the firstName and the full lastName
Example: printTeacher("John", "Doe") -> J. Doe
Write an interface for the function named printTeacherFunction.

4. Writing a class

Write a Class named StudentClass:

The constructor accepts firstName(string) and lastName(string) arguments
The class has a method named workOnHomework that return the string Currently working
The class has a method named displayName. It returns the firstName of the student
The constructor of the class should be described through an Interface
The class should be described through an Interface
Requirements:

You can reuse the Webpack configuration from the previous exercise to compile the code.
When running npm run build, no TypeScript error should be displayed.
Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

5. Advanced types Part 1

Create the DirectorInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:

workFromHome() returning a string
getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
workDirectorTasks() returning a string
Create the TeacherInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:

workFromHome() returning a string
getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
workTeacherTasks() returning a string
Create a class Director that will implement DirectorInterface

workFromHome should return the string Working from home
getToWork should return the string Getting a coffee break
workDirectorTasks should return the string Getting to director tasks
Create a class Teacher that will implement TeacherInterface

workFromHome should return the string Cannot work from home
getCoffeeBreak should return the string Cannot have a break
workTeacherTasks should return the string Getting to work
Create a function createEmployee with the following requirements:

It can return either a Director or a Teacher instance
It accepts 1 arguments:
salary(either number or string)
if salary is a number and less than 500 - It should return a new Teacher. Otherwise it should return a Director

6. Creating functions specific to employees

Write a function isDirector:

it accepts employee as an argument
it will be used as a type predicate and if the employee is a director
Write a function executeWork:

it accepts employee as an argument
if the employee is a Director, it will call workDirectorTasks
if the employee is a Teacher, it will call workTeacherTasks
Expected result:

7. String literal types

Write a String literal type named Subjects allowing a variable to have the value Math or History only. Write a function named teachClass:

it takes todayClass as an argument
it will return the string Teaching Math if todayClass is Math
it will return the string Teaching History if todayClass is History

8. Ambient Namespaces

Create a directory called task_3 and copy these configuration files into it: package.json, webpack.config.js, tsconfig.json.

The first part of will require that you build an interface and a type. Inside a file named interface.ts:

Create a type RowID and set it equal to number
Create an interface RowElement that contains these 3 fields:
firstName: string
lastName: string
age?: number
You are building the next part of the application architecture. The goal is to save the entities to a database. Because of time constraints, you can’t write a connector to the database, and you decided to download a library called crud.js. Copy this file into the task_3/js directory.

Here it is

9. Namespace & Declaration merging

Create a new directory task_4 and copy the above tsconfig.json and put this package.json in there

10. Update task_4/js/main.ts

create and export a constant cpp for Cpp Subjects
create and export a constant java for Java Subjects
create and export a constant react for React Subjects
create and export one Teacher object cTeacher with experienceTeachingC = 10
for Cpp subject, log to the console C++, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher and print the strings they return
for Java subject, log to the console Java, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher, and print the strings they return
for React subject, log to the console React, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher, and print the strings they return

11. Brand convention & Nominal typing

Create a directory task_5 and copy these configuration files into the root of task_5: package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js
